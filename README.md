## Overview
### The challenge

This Frontend mentor challenge looks very simple to me at the beginning but was very tasky as I began the learning because it took me days and helped me learn new things and relearn the tools I know before and solidify my kinowledge. It is one of my fail-success projects.After many attempts I was able to do this. I thank  God grace all through

## My process


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
### What I learned

This challenge has strected me so much beyond what I can handle. I have relearnt my CSS GRID from different resources like the MDN,W3 SCHOOLS and other useful resources, I have relearnt css units. I saw the application that [at]import rule must always be at the top of your CSS file and the two different syntax to write using strings-'' and url(). It is a big fun learning this. This project also deepens my specifity,inheritance and Cascade knowledge which I read from these books(CSS Definite Guide by Eric A. Meyer,Estelle Werl by O'Reilly Publications and Modern CSS by Joe Attardi )

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
 @import "../four-card-feature-section-master/Index.css";
```


### Continued development

Having taking up this challenge I personally discover that I have to take more projects on CSS GRIDS AND FLEXBOX for me to be able to create beautiful layouts in a short period of time so I look forward soon to set aside few days with multiple projects from simple to advance to scale up my modern css layouts instead of using old ways like ```display:table; width:33.3%```
